# Social-Network-API

## Description

The Social Network API project is another display of creating models and routes, but this time it's showing how to do that with MongoDB (NoSQL) instead of the previous homework assignment doing it within MySQL. 
This project was a further challenge to my ability to create databases, models, and routes without the added assistance of the database being right there within vscode and the command line. 
The difference in the code and setting up the files was amazing practice and a great learning experience. 
I learned more ways to set up routes for testing and creating APIs for various different usages. This project had some interesting things happen, which you will see in the video.
The POST route for creating thoughts gave a 500 error, but it still sent through the POST request. I believe there was a syntax error that I couldn't find, however the job got done. 
The DELETE route for the reactions also did not work, unfortunately, as seen at the end of the walkthrough video.
